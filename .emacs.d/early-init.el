;;; early-init.el --- -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.

;;; Code:

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold 80000000)

;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. We handle package
;; initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Faster to disable these here (before they've been initialized)
(unless (and (display-graphic-p) (eq system-type 'darwin))
  (push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist))
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)

(provide 'early-init)
;;; early-init.el ends here
